#### My story

I'm a Pythonista. Two years ago, I began with Python in the university and I joined my teacher's laboratory, this is a start point in my career path.


At that time, I learned many things: python ecosystem, machine learning basic, coding, microservice, git, and so on. I was guided by good teachers.


Two years later, I joined the Teko Vietnam JSC. This has been a good industry. It's very free and I have been happy in this environment.


I joined the catalog team when I was an internship. My team's purpose is to build a product management module for the E-Commerce system. Thus I was assigned design and coding some important parts as product model, the category management. I also write technical documents.


In our company, we build a business ecosystem. It includes the E-Commerce platform, the payment solution, travel services, and so on. Now, our company is growing and I hope our company will be a big technology company in Vietnam.
